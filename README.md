# Wandr
## Project Description :
Wandr is a web-based application with a mission to inspire individuals to step out of their comfort zones, explore diverse cultures, landscapes, and create lasting memories. We believe that every journey has a unique story, and by sharing these stories, we aim to inspire others to embark on their own adventures. Through our platform, we provide resources, inspiration, and a community for travelers to connect, exchange ideas, and foster a sense of belonging. Together, we're making the world a more connected and inspired place.
## Authentication using JWT :
In this project, we use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication, a widely accepted method for handling authentication and authorization in web applications.
### Steps to Obtain a JWT :
- *SignUP :* Create an account on the application to receive the JWT
- *Log In :* After registering, log in with your newly created credentials.
- *JWT Token :* Upon successful login, you will receive a JWT token.
